Hi! I am a Deep Learning Research Assistant at [Information Techonlogies Institute](https://www.iti.gr/iti/index.html) - CERTH, currently working on geolocation estimation.

Prior to that I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.iti.gr/iti/index.html), where I did my diploma thesis on *Zero and Few shot learning for Image Classification* with Professor [Christos Diou](https://mug.ee.auth.gr/people/christos-diou/)
